# The Geo Side of things.

At the moment, I am not working on any projects as I have a lot on my plate with academics (mental health comes first).

- I've worked on coding in Python and made a Discord bot as a free-time project.

- I'm currently learning object-orientated programming (oop) in Python and planning on learning JS, HTML and C

- May make random contributions to projects specifically in Python

- I'm mostly on Discord, X, Quora and occasionally Reddit

- Nothing else to share
